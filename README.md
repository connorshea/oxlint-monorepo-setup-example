# Monorepo example with `client/` directory for frontend code

This is a Ruby on Rails 8.1 API-only application with a React frontend in the `client/` directory.

For testing with oxlint/oxfmt to ensure we can get it working correctly for a client/ dir, preferably with minimal extra setup.

To install dependencies, run:

```bash
bundle install # can skip this probably, you don't really need to care about the Rails app.
cd client
npm install
```
